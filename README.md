# WorklogsApp

A task registration application written in Rails.

Documentation is a work in progress.

## Technology

This application works with:

  * Ruby 3.1.2
  * PostgreSQL 14 or superior
  * Redis 5

## Required dependencies:

  * Rails 7

## Configuration:

Please setup the following environment variables before running. Take in account
that you need to put your own information on these variables:

```
RAILS_DBHOST="127.0.0.1"
RAILS_DBPORT="5432"
RAILS_DBUSERNAME="railsdev"
RAILS_DBPASSWORD="railsdev"
RAILS_DEFAULT_EMAIL="dev@localhost"
RAILS_DEFAULT_EMAIL_USERNAME="developer"
RAILS_DEFAULT_EMAIL_PASSWORD="secret"
```

If you are not running on Heroku, you might also want to tune the following
parameters:

```
RAILS_MIN_THREADS=8
RAILS_MAX_THREADS=8
WEB_CONCURRENCY=10
DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database"
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1"
```

## Database creation

To create the database in development and test, please run:

```
bundle exec rails db:create
```

In production, the database should be created without a toolkit.

## Database initialization

To setup the database:

```
bundle exec rails db:setup
```

## Test suite

To execute the test suite, please execute the following command:

```
bundle exec rails test
```

## Services

  * Heroku
  * PostgreSQL
  * Redis

Soon to be implemented:

  * A search engine
  * A cache server such as memcached.
  * A job queue such as Sidekiq.

## Deployment instructions

Modify the deployment configuration in **config/deploy.rb** and then use:

```
bundle exec mina production setup
bundle exec mina production deploy
```
